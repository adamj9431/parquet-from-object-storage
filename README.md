##Access a Parquet Table From Object Storage in IBM Data Science Experience

This repository contains the supporting data and notebooks for [this tutorial](https://medium.com/@adamj9431/upload-files-to-ibm-data-science-experience-using-the-command-line-bb482fae1d73#.1z6ph8kag).

*ParquetFromObjectStorage.ipynb is the notebook used in the tutorial.
*csvToParquet.ipynb is a Python notebook that converts a subset of the GTFS-formatted transit data into a Parquet table

The input data I used is not included in the repository. The data is GTFS-formatted transit data from the MBTA (Massachusetts Bay Transit Authority). I used the Spring 2016, Version 4D data, available [here](http://transitfeeds.com/p/mbta/64/20160519)
